  abstract  = "Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling serves as the
               cornerstone for understanding drug behavior within a specific
               population. It integrates subject covariates to elucidate the
               variability in PK parameters, thus enhancing predictive accuracy.
               However, covariate modeling within this framework can be
               intricate and time-consuming due to the often obscure structural
               relationship between covariates and PK parameters. Previous
               attempts, such as deep compartment modeling (DCM), aimed to
               streamline this process using machine learning techniques.
               Nonetheless, DCM fell short in assessing residual errors and
               interindividual variability (IIV), potentially leading to model
               misspecification and overfitting. Furthermore, DCM lacked the
               ability to quantify model uncertainty. To address these
               limitations, we introduce hierarchical deep compartment modeling
               (HDCM) as an advancement of DCM. HDCM harnesses machine learning
               to discern the interplay between covariates and PK parameters
               while simultaneously evaluating diverse levels of random effects
               and quantifying uncertainty through Bayesian inference. This
               tutorial provides a comprehensive application of the HDCM
               workflow using open-source Julia tools.",

              pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole in patients known to be
              extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs). A PBPK
              model was constructed, verified, and validated against
              brexpiprazole clinical data, and simulations of 500 subjects were
              performed to establish the median time to effective concentrations
              in EMs and PMs. The PBPK simulations captured brexpiprazole PK
              well and demonstrated significant differences in the time to

              suggest that CYP2D6 PMs consistently achieve lower minimum
              concentrations during the dosing interval than CYP2D6 EMs.
              Simulations using an alternative dosing strategy of twice-daily
              dosing (as opposed to once daily) in PMs during the first week of
              brexpiprazole dosing yielded more consistent plasma concentrations

              for brexpiprazole titration in CYP2D6 PMs likely overcompensates

              A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model,
              incorporating physicochemical properties predictive of mAb
              clearance and tissue distribution, was used to estimate mAb
              exposure that maintained concentrations above 90\% inhibitory
              concentration of in vitro neutralization in lung tissue for up to
              4 weeks in 90\% of patients. To achieve fastest viral clearance
              following onset of symptoms, a longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 viral
              dynamic model was applied to estimate viral clearance as a
              function of drug concentration and dose. The PBPK model-based
              approach suggested that a clinical dose between 175 and 500 mg of
              bamlanivimab would maintain target mAb concentrations in the lung
              tissue over 28 days in 90\% of patients. The viral dynamic model
              suggested a 700 mg dose would achieve maximum viral elimination.
              Taken together, the first-in-human trial (NCT04411628)
              conservatively proceeded with a starting therapeutic dose of 700
              mg and escalated to higher doses to evaluate the upper limit of
              safety and tolerability. Availability of open-access codes and

              the selection of bamlanivimab and identified the lowest dose

              dose in EASE-3 by modelling and simulation analyses. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Independent of data from EASE-3 that tested 2.5 mg, we
              simulated the effect of a 2.5 mg dose through patient-level,
              exposure-response modelling in the EASE-2 clinical study. A
              primary semi-mechanistic model evaluated efficacy considering
              clinical insulin dose adjustments made after treatment initiation
              that potentially limited HbA1c reductions. The model was informed
              by pharmacokinetic, insulin dose, mean daily glucose and HbA1c
              data, and was verified by comparing the simulations with the
              observed HbA1c change in EASE-3. One of two empagliflozin phase 3
              trials in type 1 diabetes (EASE-3 but not EASE-2) included a lower
              2.5 mg dose. A placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction of 0.28\% was
              demonstrated without the increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis
              observed at higher doses (10 mg and 25 mg). Since only one trial
              included the lower dose, we aimed to confirm the observed
              reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose by modelling and simulation
              analyses. RESULTS: The simulated 26-week mean HbA1c change was
              -0.41\% without insulin dose adjustment and -0.29\% at 26 weeks
              with insulin dose adjustment. A simplified (descriptive) model
              excluding insulin dose and mean daily glucose confirmed the
              -0.29\% HbA1c change that would have been observed had the EASE-2
              population received a 2.5 mg dose for 26/52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS:
              The HbA1c benefit of low-dose empagliflozin directly observed in

              physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, yet the
              coefficients are challenging to measure in vivo. Several
              mechanistic-based equations have been developed to predict
              partition coefficients using tissue composition information and
              the compound's physicochemical properties, but it is not clear
              which, if any, of the methods is most appropriate under given

              tissue composition information; thereby making a controlled
              comparison impossible. This study proposed a standardized tissue
              composition for humans that can be used as a common input for each
              of the five frequently used prediction methods. These methods were
              implemented in R and were used to predict partition coefficients
              for 11 drugs, classified as strong bases, weak bases, acids,
              neutrals, and zwitterions. PBPK models developed in R (mrgsolve)
              for each drug and each set of partition coefficient predictions
              were compared to respective observed plasma concentration data.
              Percent RMSE, AUC percent error, and half-life percent error were
              used to evaluate the accuracy of the PBPK model predictions using
              each partition coefficient method as summarized by strong bases,
              weak bases, acids, neutrals, and zwitterions characterization. The
              analysis indicated that no partition coefficient method
              consistently yielded the most accurate PBPK model predictions. As
              such, PBPK model predictions using all partition coefficient
              methods should be considered during drug development. SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT: Several mechanistic-based methods exist to predict
              tissue:plasma partition coefficients critical to PBPK modeling.
              Controlled comparisons are confounded by the use of different
              tissue composition values for each method; a standardized tissue
              composition was proposed. Resulting assessments indicated that no
              method was consistently superior; therefore, sensitivity of PBPK
              predictions to each method may be warranted prior to model
              optimization.",
