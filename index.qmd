## About LUME SPACES

**Creating harmony, one space at a time.**

At Lume Spaces, we believe that true beauty lives in balance between light and texture, warmth and minimalism, form and feeling.
Our mission is to craft spaces that reflect quiet luxury, timeless elegance, and the individuality of those who live within them.

Founded in Connecticut, Lume Spaces serves clients who appreciate design as an art form, not decoration but transformation.
Whether preparing a home for market or reimagining a private residence, we bring the same attention to detail, refined palette, and understated sophistication that define our work.




## Our Approach

Every project begins with a simple question:
How do you want your space to make you feel?

From there, we design with purpose, balancing light, flow, and emotion to create interiors that are as functional as they are graceful.
Each detail is chosen with intention. Each space tells a story.




## What Defines LUME SPACES

Refined simplicity: luxury expressed through calm and clarity.

Thoughtful design: each choice serves a purpose, both aesthetic and emotional.

Timeless materials: stone, linen, natural wood, and subtle metallics.

Personal connection: we collaborate closely with clients to bring their vision to life.


## Meet the Founder

Driven by a deep appreciation for art, texture, and the psychology of space, Lume Spaces was born from a belief that our surroundings shape how we feel, think, and live.
Our founder brings an eye for modern elegance, blending transitional design with warm minimalism to create interiors that feel both elevated and inviting.




## Our Promise

To deliver not just beautiful rooms but experiences of calm sophistication.
Because when light meets intention, a house becomes a story, and that story begins with Lume.
